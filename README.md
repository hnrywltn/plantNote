# PlantNote

PlantNote is a place for you to track  plants and see what other people are growing. The main function is to write notes about specific plants, set up reminders, and to grow your collection. 


## Usage
 - You'll first create an account by signing up. 

 - After doing so, you will be redirected to the home page where you will see all the plants you have posted but also all the others that other users have posted. 

 - When clicking on one of the plants, you will be redirected to a page that shows you all the information collected for that plant. 

 - If you are the owner of that plant, there will be an edit button on the page where you can edit your plant with a pre-populated form. 

 - If you want to see only the plants that you have collected; you can click on the ToDo tab on the left you be taken to your profile. 

 - After navigating to your profile page, you'll see three things:
   * Your user information
   * A section to the right with all of the plants that you've collected
   * The bottom half of this page is where you will keep track of your toDo list

 - You can create, edit, delete, and mark your ToDos as complete.

## Roadmap
There are 3 main features that are part of my future plans for this application. 
1. Connecting an additional external API:
   * This will allow for searching, easy to find information for new plants that haven't been added yet, and for users to get more inspiration for their gardens

2. Fully implement the ToDo functionality:
   * Right now, a user isn't able to add, edit, or delete ToDos
   * The pre-populated ones are only there as an example

3. Fully implement the notes functionality:
   * When navigating to a plants information page, the user should be able to add, edit, and delete notes that they've taken for a specific plant they own
